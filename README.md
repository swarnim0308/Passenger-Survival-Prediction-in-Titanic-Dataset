# Passenger-Survival-Prediction-in-Titanic-Dataset
Titanic is known to everyone . Here we are given a Titanic dataset having some input and output features. However, for nearly 200 passengers their data of survival is missing.
Here this project aims to create a predictive ML model to predict the best possible info of survival based upon accuracy found in different ML models.
Used Random Forest Classifier Model with highest accuracy among other for the dataset.

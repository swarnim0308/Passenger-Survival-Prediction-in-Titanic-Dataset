# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The dataset contains information about the passengers, including whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the survival outcome for passengers in a test set.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two files:

1. `train.csv`: Training set with 891 rows, including the target variable (Survived).
2. `test.csv`: Test set with 418 rows, without the target variable.

## Contents

The project contains the following sections:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Importing the required Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Read In and Explore the Historic Data**: Reading and exploring the training data using the `pd.read_csv` function and the `describe` method.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the features in the dataset and their completeness.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the data using various plots and diagrams to gain insights.
5. **Cleaning Data**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant features.
6. **Choosing the Best Model**: Selecting the best model for prediction by training and evaluating different models.
7. **Creating Submission File**: Generating a submission file for the test set with predicted survival outcomes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd titanic-survival-prediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open the `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb` file.
6. Execute each cell to run the code and observe the results.
7. Modify the code as needed and experiment with different models or techniques.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, or use it as a reference for your own projects.

## Conclusion

By following this project, you will gain insights into the Titanic dataset, perform data analysis, visualize the data, clean and preprocess it, select and train models, and generate predictions. The ultimate goal is to predict the survival of passengers accurately.
